This project was a year long endeavour at the end of my undergraduate engineering journey. Essentially, this is the code that allows a robot to follow an individual based on computer vision.

# To Run: create a conda environment with python 3.8
``` conda -n "myenv" python=3.8 ```
``` conda activate myenv ```
``` conda install opencv numpy matplotlib ```

# You will need deep-sort-realtime module: 
``` pip install deep-sort-realtime ```"# Capstone"
